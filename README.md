README

The file_uploader.py will take a file, in this example Solar2.jpg, and turn it into utf8 encoded text. Then it will divide the text into three equal parts, and then save each component
as a text file. Future versions will save in chunks of ~25MB.

File downloader undoes what file uploader does. It is very hard coded, therefore it is not currently very versatile. Will be updated.
