README

The file_uploader.py will take a file, in this example Solar2.jpg, and turn it into utf8 encoded text. Then it will divide the text into three equal parts, and then save each component
as a text file. Future versions will save in chunks of ~25MB.

File downloader undoes what file uploader does. It is very hard coded and not following proper programming guidelines. This was just a test to see if an idea I had could work and I found out that it could be done. May or may not be updated in the future.
